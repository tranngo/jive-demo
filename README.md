## Inspiration
A major problem with music streaming giants like Spotify and Apple Music is that popular artists drown out smaller artists on the platform. To put things in perspective, on Spotify, the primary way people discover artists is through featured playlists but unfortunately the top 10% of artists (who constitute 99% of streams) dominate 81% of the top 100 playlists. However, we've seen how TikTok has provided a new format for artist discovery (i.e. a discovery feed that supports video) that has enabled new songs to go viral and empowered artists to gain a massive following. The issue, however, is that artists have a difficult time converting their TikTok following to music streaming platforms like Spotify and must compete with non-music content. Our goal is to create a new music streaming experience to give smaller artists a voice and increase social interaction around music.

## What it does
Artists can submit text, image, and video posts through their profile which will appear on the Discover feed to every other user. The idea is to enable artists to showcase behind-the-scenes to their music, their lifestyle, and their personality to attract new fans. 

## How we built it
I designed the interface using Figma. Tré and I built the platform using React Native for the front-end and Django for the back-end (deployed on AWS).

## Challenges we ran into
When Tré and I began the project, Tré had no experience developing mobile applications with React Native and Django. To overcome this, I spent time a lot of time pair programming with Tré to onboard him. Additionally, neither Tré nor I have experience with UI/UX design. However, after browsing through various online resources, I was able to figure out how to use Figma to design our high-fidelity mockups. Another challenge we ran into was sorting out the legalities of music intellectual property. We overcame this by reaching out to Professor Pearlman from USC's Intellectual Property & Technology Law Clinic.

## Accomplishments I'm proud of
* Developed interface using Figma with no prior experience in UI/UX design
* Gained experience coming up with a business plan and pitching the idea to people
* Learned how to implement animations in React Native

## What I've learned
I learned a lot throughout the project's development. For one, I learned that I can build solutions to problems I'm passionate about through perseverance and dedication even if I don't think I have the resources or knowledge. I also gained more experience working with AWS.

## What's next for Jive
The frontend and backend are developed separately. We're almost at the point where we can integrate the front-end and back-end to allow artists to take/upload pictures and videos. Afterwards, we can begin to build out the music streaming portion of the application. We're also currently seeking legal guidance to become DMCA compliant and hope to release a beta version soon.
